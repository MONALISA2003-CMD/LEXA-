# LEXA — Production Hardening v2.5.0

LEXA is a real multi-tenant business operating and intelligence system. The canonical business system of record is Neon PostgreSQL project `LEXA`, branch `lexa-live`, database `neondb`.

## v2.5.0 hardening

This release repairs the production weaknesses identified during the Phase 1 deep review:

- restricted `lexa_app` PostgreSQL role applied per transaction for PgBouncer-safe RLS
- bounded SQLAlchemy connection pooling and PostgreSQL timeouts
- production fail-closed environment validation
- Redis-backed login and registration rate limiting
- HttpOnly refresh-cookie rotation and memory-only access-token handling in the web app
- removal of the open-development workspace bootstrap from the shipped API and browser
- removal of the user-facing Business Engine route module
- production security response headers and generic 5xx browser responses
- migration `022_phase6a_brain_foundation` added to source convergence
- GitHub CI for backend/frontend contract verification
- direct Neon backup script using the unpooled migration/backup connection

## Canonical deployment

Vercel serves `apps/web`. Render serves `apps/api`. Neon PostgreSQL is the only authoritative LEXA business database. Do not create a second transactional database.

See `docs/MANUAL_DEPLOY_v2.5.0.md` for the exact manual handoff procedure.
